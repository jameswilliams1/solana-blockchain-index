# Solana Blockchain Index
A proof-of-concept crypto index running on the [Solana blockchain](https://solana.com/) using [the Pyth Network](https://pyth.network/) for market data.

# Developer Setup
ℹ️ If you are using Windows, consider installing [Windows Subsystem for Linux 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#install-wsl-command) - the following instructions are much easier to follow in a Linux environment where `apt` and `bash` are available (there is no official Rust installer for Windows).

- [Install rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (use the stable build and default profile)
- If using VSCode, the `rust-lang.rust` extension will be useful. For PyCharm/IntelliJ try [the JetBrains Rust plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/).
